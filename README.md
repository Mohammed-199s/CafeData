# Cafe Data Set

Our project collects key transaction details for a **Caf√©**, such as **Transaction ID**, **Item**, **Quantity**, **Price Per Unit**, **Total Spent**, **Payment Method**, **Location**, and **Transaction Date**. These insights are crucial for analyzing Caf√© operations and customer preferences. 

The dataset consists of **500 rows**, each representing a single transaction in a **caf√©**. The columns in the dataset are:

- **Transaction ID:** A unique identifier for each transaction.  
- **Item:** The item ordered (e.g., Coffee, Cake, Sandwich).  
- **Quantity:** The quantity of the item ordered.  
- **Price Per Unit:** The price of one unit of the item.  
- **Total Spent:** The total amount spent for the item (Quantity √ó Price Per Unit).  
- **Payment Method:** The method of payment used (e.g., Cash, Credit Card, Digital Wallet).  
- **Location:** The location where the transaction took place (e.g., In-store, Takeaway).  
- **Transaction Date:** The date of the transaction.
